One problem this live chat application solves is the lack of simple, real-time communication tools for small teams, student organizations, or classroom groups who need a lightweight, private chat solution without relying on third-party platforms like Discord or Slack. These platforms often come with unnecessary complexity, sign-up friction, or data privacy concerns. This app offers an easy-to-deploy, serverless alternative that enables users to instantly create or join a chat room with a unique code, communicate in real time, and see who joins or leavesâ€”all without storing user data or requiring accounts. It's ideal for on-the-fly discussions, study sessions, event coordination, or internal collaboration where simplicity and speed matter most
